# FlightSurety

FlightSurety is a sample application project for Udacity's Blockchain course.

## Install

This repository contains Smart Contract code in Solidity (using Truffle), tests (also using Truffle), dApp scaffolding (using HTML, CSS and JS) and server app scaffolding.

To install, download or clone the repo, then:

`npm install`
`truffle compile`

Configure Ganache on the default port of 7545, and deploy locally to Ganache to view structures for debugging:

`truffle migrate --network GanacheGUI`

## Develop Client

To run truffle tests:

`truffle test ./test/flightSurety.js`
`truffle test ./test/oracles.js`

To use the dapp:

`truffle migrate`
`npm run dapp`

To view dapp:

`http://localhost:8000`

After starting the dapp and deploying to Ganache, Press the "Load default contract data" button
in the top left of the webpage to populate the contract with default data like airlines, passengers,
and flights. Then, press the get flight info button to get a list of available flights.
You can use this data to input into the forms of the webpage to purchase insurance, etc.

## Develop Server

`npm run server`
`truffle test ./test/oracles.js`

## Deploy

To build dapp for prod:
`npm run dapp:prod`

Deploy the contents of the ./dapp folder
